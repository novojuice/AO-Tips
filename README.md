# Some Tips for the AO Simulation

## Struggling to Turn a Profit?

### Check Profitability in City Pairs
Check profitability in the **CITY PAIR DATA** for each city pair. Using **HISTORICAL DATA**, select the last quarter (e.g., 2025q2) and the city pair of interest.

If there is a net loss in the sector, check the **DEMAND ANALYSIS** to see if the supply of seats exceeds demand, which is often the main reason sectors are not profitable.

### Assess Load Factor
If demand exists and there is still a loss, check the **LOAD FACTOR**. A load factor substantially lower than 70% often suggests errors in airline-wide policy configuration.

### Increase Frequency on Profitable Sectors
Identify profitable sectors and consider increasing the frequency of flights. It might be preferable to eliminate low-demand sectors, reallocating the aircraft to more viable routes.

### Maximise Aircraft Utilisation
If you are leasing most of your aircraft, consider maximising their hours in the air to distribute the cost of leasing over more flights.

### Scheduling New Routes
When scheduling a new route, a list of airports from external sources, such as the Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_busiest_airports), can be helpful as a starting point. However, always verify the sector demand in-game, as the simulation does not reflect reality perfectly. Note that the game marks some international airports as domestic. Some sectors may have a surprisingly high demand, so look out for them and capitalise on them. (Look at ORD-BOS for a taste of what you might be able to find!)

## Already Turning a Profit?

### Calculate ROI
Consider calculating the ROI using **NET PROFIT / TOTAL EXPENSES** to help determine what makes some sectors more successful.
