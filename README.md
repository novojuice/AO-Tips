# Some Tips for the AO Simulation

## Scheduling Routes

### Selecting City Pairs
When scheduling a new route, a list of airports from external sources, such as the Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_busiest_airports), can be helpful as a starting point. However, always verify the sector demand in-game, as the simulation does not reflect reality perfectly. Note that the game marks some international airports as domestic. Some sectors may have a surprisingly high demand, so look out for them and capitalise on them. (Look at ORD-BOS for a taste of what you might be able to find!)

### Creating Flight Schedules
Avoid over-complicating flight routes. It is much easier to create and maintain schedules with 2-3 destinations. More complex schedules make modifying flights more challenging and are generally unnecessary unless the flights are cargo-only. This strategy promotes logical route development by encouraging the establishment of hubs in high-demand areas, where flights to and from these hubs are typically in higher demand. As the size of your fleet grows, you may also find it convenient to name your aircraft according to the routes they operate.

### Considering Route Distance
Be mindful of the distance of your routes. Although shorter routes yield more expensive tickets per kilometer, frequent short flights reduce the total flying time an aircraft can achieve due to increased layover times. Balancing between flight distance and frequency is key to optimizing operational efficiency.

### You Don't Always Need a New Route
When an existing route is profitable and has extra demand, consider duplicating it for higher frequency. You might need to stagger the new schedule by an hour or a day to ensure that you do not exceed the airport's maximum departures per hour.

## Struggling to Turn a Profit?

### Hire Managers
Although the game allows players to operate without hiring any managers, they are crucial to your operations. Always hire every type of manager available at **STAFFING > MANAGERS**. The cost of hiring them is minuscule compared to the amount of critical information you would miss out on without their insights.

### Check Profitability in City Pairs
Check profitability in the **CITY PAIR DATA** for each city pair. Using **HISTORICAL DATA**, select the last quarter (e.g., 2025q2) and the city pair of interest.

If there is a net loss in the sector, check the **DEMAND ANALYSIS** to see if the supply of seats exceeds demand, which is often the main reason sectors are not profitable.

### Assess Load Factor
If demand exists and there is still a loss, check the **LOAD FACTOR**. A load factor substantially lower than 70% often suggests errors in airline-wide policy configuration.

### Increase Frequency on Profitable Sectors
Identify profitable sectors and consider increasing the frequency of flights. It might be preferable to eliminate low-demand sectors, reallocating the aircraft to more viable routes.

### Maximise Aircraft Utilisation
If you are leasing most of your aircraft, consider maximising their hours in the air to distribute the cost of leasing over more flights.

## Already Turning a Profit?

### Calculate ROI
Consider calculating the ROI using **NET PROFIT / TOTAL EXPENSES** to help determine which sectors are more successful and why.
